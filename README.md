### Blackjack Project

Welcome to my SD Week 4 project, Blackjack! This is a fairly simple command line version of Blackjack. The rules of Blackjack have been coded in the program. Please follow the prompts to play the game. The game is based on one deck of cards. For more information of Blackjack please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) <br>

### Lessons Learned
How to manipulate data with several Classes as opposed to doing everything in the class with main. I have a greater understanding of Abstract Classes/Methods. When to utilize them and how much more efficient it is. My program was designed in a way to be used with multiple different card games. 

### How to play

When you start the program you will see my greeting. Simply look at your hand, and the one card of the dealer (one is hidden just like in the real world) Make your decision to hit or not based on that info. After you are done hitting the dealer will decide based on the login in the program if he will hit. Then the winner will be announced!
